// `match` ties an entry to a real container:
//   - Coolify apps are named like "agyagczkxvu3adrftdtpkfnz-020141617359".
//     The first part is the app's Coolify ID and stays the same across deploys,
//     so match on that. It also appears in the app's URL in the Coolify dashboard.
//   - Containers with fixed names match on the full name.
// Only containers listed here are ever reported by the API.
//
// `access`: "public"   reachable from the internet through Cloudflare Tunnel
//           "private"  not exposed to the internet, reached over Tailscale
//           "internal" only reachable from other containers on its Docker network
//
// `monitor` (optional): monitor name on the Uptime Kuma status page.
